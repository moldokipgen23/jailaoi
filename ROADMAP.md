# JailaOi — Implementation Roadmap

> **Audience:** AI agents (DeepSeek / Claude) and developers implementing tasks.
> **Rules:** Each task lists files to touch, acceptance criteria, dependencies, and verification steps. Do NOT mark a task complete unless every acceptance criterion is met.

---

## 🛡️ Architectural Ground Rules (MUST READ before any task)

These are non-negotiable. Breaking them blocks the task.

1. **dtradio compatibility.** This codebase started as the CodeCanyon dtradio admin. Future updates from CodeCanyon must be mergeable. Therefore:
   - **NEW JailaOi files** go in their own filenames (e.g., `WithdrawalController.php`, `ArtistEarning.php`).
   - **Modifying dtradio originals** is allowed only when no separate file would work. Mark the change with a `// JAILAOI:` comment so future merges can spot it.
   - Never delete original dtradio files unless 100% certain they're unused (grep the entire codebase first, including views and routes).

2. **Database changes.** Use Laravel migrations only. Never edit existing migrations — add new ones. Migrations must be idempotent (use `Schema::hasColumn`, `Schema::hasTable` checks). Live database `jailaoic_jailaoinew` must keep working after the migration runs.

3. **Backward compatibility for live app.** Users are on Play Store APK. Any API change must keep the old APK working:
   - New endpoints: fine.
   - New fields in responses: fine.
   - Removing/renaming fields/endpoints: NOT ALLOWED.
   - Changing response shape: NOT ALLOWED.

4. **Two Flutter folders confusingly named.** The real Flutter project is at `Jailaoi app/` (with space). NOT `app/`. Always verify with `ls` before edits.

5. **Live server.** `m.jailaoi.com` on cPanel, branch `main`, no SSH (terminal only).

6. **Live DB credentials are in .env on server** — never commit them.

7. **No silent error swallowing.** All `try/catch` blocks must log errors via Laravel `Log::error()` (backend) or `printLog()` (Flutter).

8. **Test before pushing.** PHP: `php -l <file>`. Dart: `flutter analyze`. Both must pass.

---

## 📦 BATCH STRUCTURE

Each batch is a coherent unit. Complete batch 1 fully before batch 2. After each batch:
1. Commit + push to `main`.
2. Deploy to `m.jailaoi.com` (`git pull`, `php artisan migrate --force`, clears).
3. Smoke test on live server.
4. Send the diff/PR back to Claude for review.
5. Move to next batch.

# 🔴 BATCH 1 — Critical Infrastructure & Trust (1-2 weeks)

Goal: stop bleeding. Make the platform reliable + trustworthy before adding features.

---

### TASK 1.1 — Audio CDN Migration

**Why:** Audio files are served from PHP server. Won't scale past ~50 concurrent listeners. Must move to CDN.

**Scope:**
- Set up Cloudflare R2 bucket (or AWS S3 + CloudFront). Use Cloudflare R2 (cheaper, free egress).
- Add disk config in `config/filesystems.php` for R2.
- Update Music upload (`User/MusicController.php`), Radio upload (`User/RadioController.php`), Podcast upload to write audio files to R2 instead of local `storage/app/public/music`, etc.
- Update `Common::Get_Song()` helper to return R2 public URL for files stored on R2.
- Add a feature flag `audio_storage_driver` in `tbl_general_setting` (values: `local` or `r2`). Default `local`. Only flip to `r2` after testing.
- One-off Artisan command: `php artisan jailaoi:migrate-audio-to-r2` to copy existing local audio files to R2 + update DB paths.

**Files:**
- `config/filesystems.php` (add r2 disk)
- `.env.example` (document R2_BUCKET, R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID, R2_SECRET, R2_ENDPOINT, R2_PUBLIC_URL)
- `app/Models/Common.php` (modify Get_Song)
- `app/Http/Controllers/User/MusicController.php` `RadioController.php`
- `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/SongController.php` `MusicController.php` `PodcastController.php`
- `app/Console/Commands/MigrateAudioToR2.php` (new)

**Acceptance:**
- New uploads with flag = `r2` end up on R2 and play in the app.
- Existing songs (flag = `local`) still play unchanged.
- Migration command copies files + updates DB.
- Flutter app needs zero changes (URLs come from API).
- Old APK on Play Store continues working.

**Verification by Claude:** Show me one new upload from `/user/music` working on R2, and an old local-file song still playing.

**Estimated effort:** 1-2 days.

---

### TASK 1.2 — Background Job Queue

**Why:** Email sending, image processing, payment webhooks block requests. Need queue.

**Scope:**
- Configure Laravel queue driver = `database`.
- Add migration for `jobs` table (Laravel default).
- Add migration for `failed_jobs` table.
- Create cron entry that runs `php artisan queue:work --stop-when-empty --max-time=50` every minute via cPanel cron.
- Convert all `Mail::send` calls and any heavy ops to `dispatch(Job::class)`.

**Files:**
- `config/queue.php` (driver default = `database`)
- migrations for `jobs` and `failed_jobs` if not present
- `app/Jobs/` (new folder)
- cPanel cron entry (document in README)

**Acceptance:**
- Sending a welcome email returns instantly; email arrives within ~1 minute (cron-driven).
- `failed_jobs` table populated when job fails (for debugging).

**Verification by Claude:** Show me an email being queued + processed.

**Estimated effort:** Half a day.

---

### TASK 1.3 — Email Verification on Signup

**Why:** Anyone can register with fake email; no abuse control. Block artist portal until verified.

**Scope:**
- Add `email_verified_at` column on `tbl_user` if not present.
- Send verification email on registration (via the queue from Task 1.2).
- Add `/user/verify-email/{token}` route + handler.
- Block login at `/user/login` if `role='artist'` and `email_verified_at IS NULL`.
- Show "Verify email" page with "Resend verification" button.
- Token table or signed URL (use Laravel signed URLs).

**Files:**
- New migration if column missing
- `app/Http/Controllers/User/RegisterController.php` (dispatch verify mail)
- `app/Http/Controllers/User/LoginController.php` (block unverified)
- `app/Mail/VerifyEmail.php` (new)
- `resources/views/emails/verify-email.blade.php` (new)
- `resources/views/user/verify/index.blade.php` (new)
- `routes/user.php` (add verify routes)

**Acceptance:**
- New artist application → verification email sent.
- Clicking link verifies and lets them log in.
- Unverified user trying to log in sees "please verify" message.
- "Resend" link works.

**Verification by Claude:** Show full end-to-end: registration → email → click → login.

**Estimated effort:** 1 day.

---

### TASK 1.4 — Artist Approval / Rejection / Withdrawal Email Notifications

**Why:** Right now everything is silent. Artists don't know when they're approved or paid.

**Scope:**
- 3 notification emails sent via queue:
  1. Artist application **approved** → "Welcome! Log in at m.jailaoi.com/user"
  2. Artist application **rejected** → include admin's rejection note
  3. Withdrawal **approved/paid** → amount + reference
- Trigger from `Admin/ArtistRequestController` approve/reject methods and `Admin/WithdrawalController`.
- All emails branded with JailaOi pink (#E01E75).

**Files:**
- `app/Mail/ArtistApprovedMail.php`, `ArtistRejectedMail.php`, `WithdrawalPaidMail.php` (new)

- `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/ArtistRequestController.php` (dispatch on action)
- `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/WithdrawalController.php` (dispatch on paid)

**Acceptance:**
- Approve an artist in admin → email arrives with login instructions.
- Reject with note → email contains the note.
- Mark withdrawal as paid → email arrives with amount.

**Verification by Claude:** Show me the 3 emails received in inbox.

**Estimated effort:** Half a day.

---

### TASK 1.5 — Migrated Artist Password Reset Blast

**Why:** 75 migrated artists are on old DeepSound passwords they likely don't remember.

**Scope:**
- One-off Artisan command: `php artisan jailaoi:blast-migrated-artist-emails`.
- For every user where `role='artist'` AND `last_login_at IS NULL` (or created_at < migration date), send a "Welcome to JailaOi — set your password" email containing a one-time signed reset link.
- Use the existing password reset flow (Task done).
- Throttle 100 emails/hour to avoid SMTP limits.

**Files:**
- `app/Console/Commands/BlastMigratedArtistEmails.php` (new)
- `app/Mail/MigratedArtistWelcomeMail.php` (new)
- `resources/views/emails/migrated-artist-welcome.blade.php` (new)

**Acceptance:**
- Running command sends emails to all qualifying users.
- Each email contains a working reset link.
- Command is rerunnable (skips users already emailed in last 7 days).

**Verification by Claude:** Show me the email + clicking link works.

**Estimated effort:** 2 hours.

---

### TASK 1.6 — Better Playback Error Handling

**Why:** Dead song URLs cause silent failures. Users abandon.

**Scope:**
- Backend: new table `tbl_play_error` (id, user_id, content_id, content_type, url, error_message, http_status, created_at).
- New endpoint `POST /api/log_play_error` that logs the error.
- Flutter: when `audioPlayer` throws a `PlayerException` or load error, do these in order:
  1. Call `log_play_error` API with details.
  2. Show user-friendly toast: "This track is unavailable, skipping…"
  3. Auto-skip to next track in playlist.
- Admin page `/admin/play-errors` showing errors with content + count (so admin can fix dead URLs).

**Files:**
- New migration `tbl_play_error`
- `app/Models/PlayError.php` (new)
- `app/Http/Controllers/Api/HomeController.php` add `log_play_error` method
- `routes/api.php` add route
- `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/PlayErrorController.php` (new)
- `resources/views/admin/play_errors/index.blade.php` (new)
- Flutter: `app/lib/music/musicmanager.dart` and `musicdetails.dart` — handle PlayerException + call API

**Acceptance:**
- Playing a broken URL logs an error, shows toast, skips to next track.
- Admin can see all errors in `/admin/play-errors`.

**Verification by Claude:** Show me a broken-URL scenario + the admin error page entry.

**Estimated effort:** 1 day.

# 🟠 BATCH 2 — Foundation Music Features (1-2 weeks)

Goal: turn this from "demo" to "real music platform."

---

### TASK 2.1 — Album / EP Grouping

**Acceptance:**
- Heart icon on tracks → adds to library.
- Library tab shows all 4 sections.
- Recently played auto-updates.

**Verification by Claude:** Show me liking a song + it appearing in library.
